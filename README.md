# Ghanavats.ResultPattern
A Robust and Flexible Result Handling Framework for Modern Applications

## Overview
Ghanavats.ResultPattern is a small/simple, unambitious framework designed to bring consistency 
and flexibility to result handling in your applications. 
Whether you need to return simple success/error outcomes or handle complex validation scenarios, 
this solution provides the tools you need to implement robust result patterns effortlessly.

The idea behind this was to learn the Result Pattern by implementing it in a good way. 
The plan was not and is not to get all developers, worldwide, to adopt it. 
Instead, to teach myself, and maybe if I am lucky, to show you what it may look like. 

## The solution includes

1. **Ghanavats.ResultPattern NuGet Package**

    A fully-featured implementation of the result pattern, offering generic results for any type, extensions for FluentAssertions, and comprehensive validation support.
By leveraging this solution, developers can simplify their workflows, reduce boilerplate code, and establish a consistent approach to handling results across projects.
