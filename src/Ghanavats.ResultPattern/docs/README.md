# Ghanavats Result Patter package
Consistent and Flexible Result Handling for Developers to have better control over responses.

## Overview
The Ghanavats.ResultPattern NuGet package offers a powerful and adaptable approach 
to returning results from methods and handlers. 

Built on a well-known pattern, 
this implementation provides flexibility for developers to design and extend their own result-handling strategies.

Key features include:

* Generic Results: Support for results based on any type, ensuring versatility across various use cases.
* Simple Success/Error Handling: Seamless handling of scenarios where only success or error outcomes are needed.
* Validation Support: Integrated with FluentAssertion's ValidationResult, it includes an extension method to populate a list of ValidationError instances. The custom ValidationError class simplifies returning invalid results with validation failures clearly defined.

### Future-Ready and Comprehensive:
Ghanavats.ResultPattern goes beyond common scenarios, 
providing developers with a robust framework for consistent result management 
that fits projects of any size or complexity.
